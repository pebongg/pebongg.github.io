is a static website using the Github Repository, precisely the Github Pages environment that uses HTML, CSS and Javascript language technologies without using frameworks<br>
<br>
My background for making this static website is my lack of media to convey more detailed information about myself to colleagues, friends, family or job recruiters. For that, with this static website, it can help me provide more detailed information about myself as well show how my basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript is applied in a website without using a framework
